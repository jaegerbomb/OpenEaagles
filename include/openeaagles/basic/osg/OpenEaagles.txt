
Based on OpenSceneGraph-3.0.1

OpenEaagles is using just the osg math library (math, vec2, vec3, vec4, matrix and quat)

To keep this version from interfering with the full OSG packages, we made these changes ...
   1) wrapped in 'Eaagles' namespace
   2) changed #include paths from <osg/XXX> to "./XXX"
   3) removed several osg specific include files (eg, <osg/Config>)
   4) switching between float and double using "LCREAL_DOUBLE"
   5) removed OSG_EXPORT
   6) added 'value_type' casts to remove 'double' to 'float' warnings
   7) added several new functions (eg. transpose())
